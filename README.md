# 🍽️ CodeChef Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **CodeChef** problems, implemented in C++. It serves both as a portfolio of problem-solving skills and a reference for algorithms and data structures.

---
## 🛠 Languages & Tools

- **C++** — primary language used  
- **Standard Template Library (STL)** — for data structures and algorithms
- **OOP**

---
## ✅ How to Use / Run

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bola-nabil/codechef.git
```

---
## 🎯 Goals & Learning Objectives

- Strengthen **problem-solving** by tackling challenge problems
- Practice **algorithms and data structures** under constraints
- Develop a clean and reusable code base
- Build a portfolio to show off skills in competitive programming

---
## 🚀 Roadmap / Future Improvements

- Add problem statements or links for each solution
- Organize by topic (Sorting, Greedy, DP, Graphs, etc.)
- Write explanations / comments for each solution
- Include test cases or input-output examples
- Benchmark performance for larger constraints
- Extend solutions to other languages (Python, Java, etc.)
